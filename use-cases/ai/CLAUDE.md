# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A monorepo demonstrating Teleport's agentic identity and multi-agent workflows. Multiple specialized AI agents (agents) each operate with their own Machine ID credentials via tbot sidecars, accessing infrastructure through Teleport separately from the user's identity. Agents communicate using the Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol over HTTP/JSON-RPC.

Key capabilities:

- **Teleport App Access discovery** -- the orchestrator can discover agents dynamically via `tsh apps ls` with label selectors, or use static URLs.
- **Inter-agent auth** -- the orchestrator's tbot sidecar creates application-tunnel connections to each agent through Teleport, authenticating with its own bot identity.
- **Configurable LLM** -- a shared factory supports Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and Ollama backends via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var.
- **Agent identity metadata** -- each agent's Agent Card includes `TbotIdentityInfo` describing its bot name and tbot services, surfaced in the frontend.
- **Teleport MCP Access discovery** -- an agent can discover MCPs dynamically via `tsh mcp ls`.

**Architecture flow:** User authenticates via Teleport -> accesses Web frontend via App Access -> backend validates Teleport JWT assertion token -> forwards prompts to orchestrator via A2A -> orchestrator decomposes tasks and delegates to specialized agents -> each agent uses its own tbot sidecar credentials to access resources (SSH, databases, Kubernetes, applications, and MCPs) through Teleport.

### Services

- **frontend** -- Chainlit based web frontend <https://docs.chainlit.io>
- **orchestrator** -- LangGraph-based agent that discovers agents using Teleport App Access `tsh apps ls` with label selectors, converts each to a LangChain tool, and routes tasks to appropriate agents
- **agent-ssh** -- SSH command execution agents (port 8081), uses tbot ssh-multiplexer
- **agent-quotes** -- Quotes API agents (port 8082), uses tbot application-tunnel
- **agent-db** -- Database query agents (port 8083), uses tbot database-tunnel
- **agent-k8s** -- Kubernetes operations agents (port 8084), uses tbot kubernetes/v2
- **agent-mcp** -- MCP bridge agents (port 8085), dynamically discover MCP servers via `tsh mcp ls` and bridge their tools using tbot identity

## Skills

This project includes Claude Code skills for working with Teleport:

- **`.claude/skills/tbot.md`** -- Teleport Machine & Workload Identity agent (CLI). Covers all output types (identity, database, kubernetes, application, workload-identity-*), service types (tunnels, proxies, SPIFFE Workload API), Kubernetes Helm deployment, join methods, SPIFFE/workload identity setup, and bot management.
- **`.claude/skills/tsh.md`** -- Teleport client CLI for infrastructure access. Covers SSH, database, Kubernetes, application, cloud provider, MCP, and git access through Teleport's proxy. Includes all proxy commands, access requests, headless auth, VNet, and integration patterns with tbot for automated workloads.
- **`.claude/skills/tbot-api.md`** -- Embedding tbot in Go applications. Covers the `embeddedtbot` wrapper package, core `bot.Bot` API, configuration (connection, onboarding, credential lifetime, destinations), `clientcredentials` in-memory credential service, lifecycle management, and patterns for Kubernetes operators, Terraform providers, and custom services.
- **`.claude/skills/tctl.md`** -- Teleport admin CLI for cluster management. Covers resource CRUD (get/create/edit/rm), users, bots, tokens, nodes, certificate authorities (auth export/sign/rotate), access requests, locks, alerts, devices, inventory, recordings, SSO configuration, plugins, workload identity, audit, auto-update, and integration patterns with tbot and Terraform.
- **`.claude/skills/teleport.md`** -- Teleport server daemon. Covers all service roles (auth, proxy, node, app, db, kube, discovery), start/configure commands, database configuration and bootstrapping, cloud integration configure (AWS OIDC, EC2 SSM, EKS, Azure, GCP), backend management, debug commands, OpenSSH joining, and systemd installation.
- **`.claude/skills/fdpass-teleport.md`** -- Teleport SSH file descriptor passing helper. Covers the fd-passing architecture for tbot's ssh-multiplexer, ProxyCommand integration with OpenSSH 9.4+, usage examples, and troubleshooting.
